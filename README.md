# Long Range Autonomous Surface Vehicle
Autonomous surface vehicle powered by an Arduino featuring a radio-based telemetry system and waypoint tracking

## About The Project 
In this project, I developed a long range autonomous boat that can track GPS waypoints. In addition, I incorporated a robust telemetry system that transmits realtime data from the boat to the ground station which is displayed on a Python based GUI. 

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
* The control panel was created using **Python3.7** and **Tkinter**
* The Arduino IDE is necessary to run Arduino scripts and program your Arduino board. The IDE can be downloaded at the following link: https://www.arduino.cc/en/software

### Installation
To install all the necessary scripts and files for the Long Range Autonomous Surface Vehicle, clone this repository using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/kousheekc/Long-Range-Autonomous-Surface-Vehicle.git
```

## Usage
To run the control panel on your ground station PC, open a terminal, navigate to the folder you just cloned and run the following commands:
```
cd control_panel
python3 -m app
```
Once the app is running the interface is self-explanatory. The features of the app are listed below.
